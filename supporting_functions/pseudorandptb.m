function [pseudovector,index] = pseudorandptb(vector)

% [pseudovector,index] = pseudorandptb(vector)
% This function uses the PTB function Shuffle to pseudorandomize the input vector in the following way:
% in a vector with repeated values, it randomizes the values until the resulting vector has no equal consecutive values.
% It also gives the index of the (pseudo)randomization as output, the same way that Shuffle does.

% vector that will get a value of one if a value in the shuffled vector is euqal to its following value %
    repetitionindexvector = zeros((length(vector)-1),1);

    while 1
        
        % randomize vector
        [pseudovector,index] = Shuffle(vector);
        
        for v=1:(length(pseudovector)-1)

            if sum(pseudovector(v)+pseudovector(v+1)) == 2*pseudovector(v)
                truefalseindex=1; % 1 if a number is equal to its following number in the shuffled vector
            else
                truefalseindex=0; % 0 otherwise
            end

            repetitionindexvector(v) = truefalseindex;

        end
        
        % if all values in this vector are zeros, no value is repeated adjecently
        % hence meeting our criterion for a successful pseudorandomization 
        if sum(repetitionindexvector) == 0 
            break
        end
